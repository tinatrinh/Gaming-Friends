                            <p>The day on when we saw a glimpse of an unspeakable horror that is yet to come? The day that we were all watching innocently of an amazing streamer until... the search history was accidently flashed. A good fellow friend/viewer of this streamer had very fast eyes, and saw the beginning of memes to come. I was instantly alerted of this situation, and my fast hands and thinking went to start my lifetime of turkey memes. We tried to get a confession out of him on why he even searched that, but alas, he had nothing to say for himself. He probably thought it would blow over after a couple of days, but was he oh so wrong... He forgets he has amazing friends who will troll him to the day he dies, and myself, who will meme the shit out of anyone who gives me content. That is when the trolling began, and it doesn't end there...</p>

                            <p>I had just woken up and wanted to make myself some cereal. As I was pouring the milk into the bowl, I glanced on the side and saw a missing ad. The turkey was already stripped and ready in the picture. I thought to myself, "I must save the turkeys!" On the news, Press was still looking for his turkey everywhere, but couldn't find it. I'm guessing maybe Nite saved them all, so Press cannot get his hands on them. But because of this, Press lost his mind without the accompany of his turkey, and this led to my next part... </p>

                            <p>As time went on, and Press kept searching. He felt lost in life. This now becomes a sad story, because when Press realizes he is not allowed to be near a turkey, he started to see everyone as his beloved turkey. His favorite streamers, his mouse, even his pillow. They are all turkeys to him now. Did he ever recover, if you are wondering? Probably, until I made this site out of boredom because I'm practicing schoolwork, hehe. Anyways, you're amazing, Press. Thanks for always being amazing you and having laughs together! </p>
